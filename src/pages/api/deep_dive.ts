    Based on these real user reviews, provide the following sections:
    
    1. Quantitative Analysis: Data-driven insights about the impact of this theme on users, including patterns in ratings, frequency of mentions, and trends over time.
    
    2. Qualitative Analysis: Deeper understanding of how users experience this theme, including common sentiments, specific user pain points or delights, and contextual factors.
    
    3. Root Cause Analysis: Technical and product reasons behind this theme, what might be causing these user experiences based on the reviews.
    
    4. Product Implications: How this theme affects business metrics and user experience, including potential impact on retention, acquisition, and user satisfaction.
    
    5. Customer Quotes: Five most representative quotes from the reviews that illustrate this theme (include source).
    
    Format the response as a JSON object with these keys: quantitativeAnalysis, qualitativeAnalysis, rootCauseAnalysis, productImplications, and customerQuotes (an array of objects with quote and source).
    
    IMPORTANT: All fields must be simple strings, not nested objects. Do not include nested objects in any of the fields.
